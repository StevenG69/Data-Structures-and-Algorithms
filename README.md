# Trip Planner Project

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Implement a program `tripPlan.c` that finds **optimal walking and ferry routes** between landmarks in a city, based on user-specified departure times and preferences. The city may be disconnected by foot, but ferry services can bridge otherwise unreachable areas.

The solution must use appropriate **graph data structures** and **graph algorithms**, and handle increasingly complex scenarios across four stages.

## ðŸ“¥ Input Format

### 1. Landmarks
- Integer `l` (number of landmarks, `l > 0`)
- `l` lines: each contains a landmark name (max 31 chars, no spaces, case-sensitive)

### 2. Walking Links
- Integer `w` (`w â‰¥ 0`)
- `w` triplets: `landmark1 landmark2 walking_time`  
  (undirected, walking_time > 0)

### 3. Ferry Schedules
- Integer `f` (`f â‰¥ 0`)
- `f` quadruplets: `from_landmark depart_time to_landmark arrive_time`  
  - Times in `hhmm` 24-hour format (e.g., `0930`)
  - `arrive_time > depart_time`, all within same day

### 4. User Queries
Repeated blocks until `From: done`:
